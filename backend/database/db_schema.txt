1️⃣ users

Purpose: Stores all platform users (students & admins)

Why needed:

Identifies who uploads resumes

Identifies who gets tasks assigned

Distinguishes admin vs student behavior

2️⃣ resumes

Purpose: Stores raw and parsed resume data

Why needed:

Keeps original resume text for re-processing

Stores structured skill extraction (JSONB)

Acts as the source of truth for user skills & domain

3️⃣ skills

Purpose: Master list of all known skills

Why needed:

Avoids duplicate skill names (Python vs python)

Enables normalization and clean joins

Allows consistent skill matching across users & tasks

4️⃣ user_skills

Purpose: Maps users to their skills with proficiency

Why needed:

Stores who knows what

Tracks skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

Used directly by the skill-matching agent

5️⃣ projects

Purpose: Represents high-level real-world projects

Why needed:

Groups related work under one project

Defines domain and complexity

Allows admins to manage large initiatives

6️⃣ modules

Purpose: Breaks projects into logical components

Why needed:

Makes large projects assignable

Enables parallel contribution

Natural boundary for agent-driven task creation

7️⃣ tasks

Purpose: Smallest assignable unit of work

Why needed:

This is what students actually work on

Tracks task status (pending / assigned / completed)

Used for skill matching and recommendation

8️⃣ task_skills

Purpose: Defines skill requirements for each task

Why needed:

Enables skill ↔ task compatibility checks

Supports required vs optional skills

Supports minimum proficiency constraints

9️⃣ task_assignments

Purpose: Tracks which user is assigned to which task

Why needed:

Prevents double assignment

Tracks progress & submission status

Enables performance analytics later
